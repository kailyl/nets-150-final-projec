We hope to do a combination of Implementation and Empirical Analysis in order to answer the following question: do U.S. senators from the 117th Congress have a greater likelihood of sharing a seniority range (how long they've served in Congress) if they are members of the same sub-committee? We plan to do web-scraping on this Senate Committee Assignments page and this Wikipedia page about senators in order to gather information about which senators belong to which sub-committees and what their respective seniority is. With this information, we'll create a graph where the nodes are the senators and the edges are constructed based on shared sub-committees. Then, we want to (1) compute the average cluster coefficients for each node of the graph, (2) compute the average cluster coefficients of an isolated graph where all the nodes share a common seniority, and (3) compute the average cluster coefficients of an isolated graph where all the nodes have a distinct seniority.
