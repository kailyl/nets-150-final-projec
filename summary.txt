Age in Congressional Committees

Description:
Currently the 117th Congress of the United States is made up of around 200 committees and subcommittees. With the power
to create the laws in the country, members of Congree unquestionably play an important role in how important
issues in today's society are addressed. Thus, we wanted to analyze the diversity, or lack there of, within each
committee with regards to age. More formally, we used a combination of both Implementation and Empirical Analysis 
to answer the question of whether or not members of the same committee of congress are more likely to fall 
within the same generational age range. Our project incorporates both Graphs and Graph Algorithms and
Information Networks, and the work was distributed between the members as follows: Kaily Liu was in charge of pulling
and processing the age data from the Wikepedia page (linked in the report). Anna V was in charge of pulling and processing
the committee data from the US senate page (also linked in the report). Anna Z took on the task of writing the code for the
graph analysis. We all jointly worker on the project report.
